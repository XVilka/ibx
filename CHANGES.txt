            variant for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

            More flexible error handling: The inclusion of `Tws_error`
            messages into the values of a pipe of a streaming request
            enables pattern matching on Tws_error's.

2013-04-18: Port number for TWS clients is no longer optional.

2013-04-16: Added a new interface `Twsable`.
